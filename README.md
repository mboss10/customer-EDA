# Customer Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
In this project, I took on the challenge of uncovering insights from a [simulated customer dataset](https://github.com/mboss10/customer-EDA/blob/main/sources/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20%5BCustomer%20Data%5D%20-%20Data.csv). Through a detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), I explored patterns, trends, and key metrics to transform raw data into actionable insights. Below, I share the methodology, findings, and takeaways from this analytical journey.  

## Methodology and tools used
To accomplish this project I decided to first start by **exploring** the data using my understanding of the [data definition file](https://github.com/mboss10/customer-EDA/blob/main/sources/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20%5BCustomer%20Data%5D%20-%20Data%20Description.csv) provided and a couple of SQL queries. I loaded the data in a SQL client, **DBeaver**, and I started my exploration around 2 key facts that I identified: **Revenue, $** and **Usage, DBUs**.
NB: I have provided with my assignment all the SQL queries I used in the Databricks_EDA.sql file.To accomplish this assignment I decided to first start by exploring the data using my understanding of the data definition file provided and a couple of SQL queries.
